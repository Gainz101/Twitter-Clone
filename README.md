# Twitter-Clone
I recreated Twitter from a frontend perspective as a personal project in the summer. The application fully supports customizable tweet bodies, profile icons, statistics (like count, views), twitter handles, display names, and dates. It also supports a functional retweet popup screen, view popup screen, and like functionality. Dev time: couple days.
