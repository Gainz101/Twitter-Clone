# Twitter-Clone
I recreated the Twitter Application from a frontend perspective as a personal project in the summer. The application has fully customizable tweet bodies, profile icons, statistics (like count, views), twitter handles, display names, and dates. It also supports a functional retweet popup screen, view popup screen, and like functionality towards a tweet. This was built in react-native as a learning opportunity and it took overall a couple days to create. Enjoy!
